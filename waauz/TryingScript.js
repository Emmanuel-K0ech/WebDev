// var is used mostly if you want to run you code on an old browser

/* it is a good programming practice to declare all variables at the 
 beginning of a script */
 // Re-declaring a variable will only work with the keyword 'var'
 // underscores are used for 'hidden variables'
 // dollars signs are used for selecting HTML elements
 // let keyword offers a block scope for variables...cannot be accessed from outside the curly braces
